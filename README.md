C# Modular Menu System
Overview

This project is a modular console-based application built in C#. It demonstrates the use of iterative structures, error handling, and object-oriented programming principles through three distinct tools combined into a single menu-driven system:

Energy Calculator – Estimates electricity usage based on appliance power rating and usage hours.

Product Listing System – Allows products to be added to categories, calculates total costs and quantities, and lists items by category.

Text Encoder – Encodes user-inputted text into a simple binary representation.

Features

Modular design with each tool contained in its own class for scalability.

Menu navigation implemented with iterative structures for smooth user interaction.

Robust input validation and error handling, including back-navigation to previous steps.

Object-oriented product management with Product and Category classes.

Full testing plan covering functional, boundary, and stress cases.
